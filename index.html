          <div class="body-text">I completed my undergraduate in physics and mathematics, which were my favourite subjects growing up. I’ve used Python (Jupyter notebook) for my computational labs at McGill University. After transferring to The University of Sydney, I also learned MATLAB and R and other basic SQL commands. I have lived in Saudi Arabia, Canada, Australia and the United States but moving to Australia was the most challenging transition. However, I’m really grateful for such an experience because it allowed me to improve my skills academically and socially.

          <div class="body-text">Since I enjoyed coding, exploring and analyzing data during my studies, I decided to pivot and started learning Python again on my own time. I enrolled recently in the UBC data science certificate program to expand my knowledge and skills. .
		</div>
	  <div class="body-text">Apart from that, I  like skateboarding as a sport. I also love painting and making art. I would love to make digital art one-day using code. My favourite authors are Brianna Wiest and Naguib Mahfouz. In my free time, I like reading manga and watching anime from time to time. Raising and helping street cats is an obsession of mine. I have two female cats, Lucy (10 years old) and Sasha (5 years old). </div>
