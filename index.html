          <div class="body-text">I completed my undergraduate in physics and mathematics, which were my favourite subjects growing up. I’ve used Python since 2017 for my computational labs at McGill University. After transferring to The University of Sydney, I also learned MATLAB, R, and other basic SQL commands. I have lived and studied in different countries including Saudi Arabia, Canada, Australia and the United States. I’m grateful for such an experience as it allowed me to improve my academic and social skills.

          <div class="body-text">I enjoyed coding, exploring and analyzing data during my undergraduate, so I decided to pivot and started learning Python again on my own time. I enrolled recently in the UBC data science certificate program to expand my knowledge and skills. 
		</div>
	  <div class="body-text">Apart from that, I like skateboarding as a sport. I also love painting and making art. I would love to make digital art one day using code. My favourite authors are Brianna Wiest and Naguib Mahfouz. I speak English, Arabic, Turkish, and Korean. I’m currently learning French in Montreal, QC. In my free time, I like reading manga and spending time with my cats, Lucy and Sasha.  </div>
