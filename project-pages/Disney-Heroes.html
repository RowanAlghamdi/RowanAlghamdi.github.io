We used the total gross and the adjusted total gross after inflation to explore which genre and hero has the highest average revenue. Based on House Committee on Oversight and Reformthe, we relied in this analysis on the average of the adjusted total gross after inflation to derive the results. The outcomes were as follows: Musical genre is the most popular genre produced by Disney and Snow white is the most famous Disney character. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs movie has been published in 1937 and recreated and republished several times by the Walt Disney Studios. Therefore, the computed results aline with the hero's character background and success. </div>
